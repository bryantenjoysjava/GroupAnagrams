# Thoughts
This problem created some difficulties for me, my first thought was a hashtable and sorting the strings, then taking the counts of each string and comparing them to one another.
I initially solved the problem in this,  but looked up a solution that didnt involve a sorted function and the most popular solution was this. While I understand it, 
the indexing of letters by translating them into their ascii comparitive seems to be more of a knowledge based problem rather than intuition based. For this particular solution, I feel
like one either remembers this solution or doesnt, the chances of someone coming up with this the first time through seems highly improbable.
