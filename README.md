# Thoughts
This problem created some difficulties for me, my first thought was a hashtable and sorting the strings, then taking the counts of each string and comparing them to one another.
I initially solved the problem like this, but looked up a solution that didnt involve using the built-in python sorted function and uploaded it for my own sake. While I understand 
the solution, the indexing of letters by translating them into their ascii comparitive seems to be more of a knowledge based problem rather than intuition based. I feel like one either remembers this specific solution or doesnt, the chances of someone coming up with this the first time through seems highly improbable.
